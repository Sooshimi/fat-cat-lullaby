# Lullaby

You can play our game on Itch.io! - https://sooshimi.itch.io/lullaby

Lullaby was made in participation in the Godot Wild Jam #63. This was a 9-day game jam, and the theme was 'Cats'.

This game was made in the Godot engine (v4.1.3) by myself, and my friend Ramazir created the art, animations and music! There are also some borrowed assets used in this, who's authors are in the game Credits page.
